### Sampi Sorter for PFK Co.
Contributed to the development of The Sampi Sorter, an intelligent agricultural grain sorter. In this industrial project, I served as an AI developer. My responsibilities included training a YOLO model for accurate bean detection and subsequently training a CNN to classify each detected bean into its respective category. This project presented challenging tasks in both detection and classification, ultimately improving efficiency in the sorting process.

### Smart Pedestrian Crosswalk for PFK Co.
Engineered a comprehensive safety system utilizing Deep Stream for precise pedestrian detection on crosswalks and radar technology to identify approaching vehicles. Implemented on Jetson Orin Nano, this system is designed to enhance road safety by issuing timely warnings to both pedestrians and drivers, ensuring a proactive approach to preventing potential accidents at crosswalks.

### Karabin Embedded Camera for PFK Co
The Karabin Embedded LPR Camera is a comprehensive all-in-one system, featuring color and infrared cameras, image processing, control and power electronic units, and a specialized lighting module for ANPR. In this project, I played a role in enhancing its capabilities by integrating a vehicle-type classification module. This addition expanded the functionality of the system, providing advanced features for efficient vehicle monitoring and categorization.
