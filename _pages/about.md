I'm Zahra Abbasi. I'm a Machine Learning Engineer with a passion for AI. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Alzahra University in Tehran, Iran. 
Soon after, I started working as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Pouya Fanavaran Kosar](http://en.pfkvision.com), a company that works on machine vision technology.
In this position, I was responsible for developing and deploying machine learning models for various applications, such as object detection ND image classification. I also worked on training and fine-tuning deep learning models to improve their performance and accuracy. Furthwemore, I was involved in the development of applications that use machine learning models for different tasks. You can find more details about my work experience in Projects section.
