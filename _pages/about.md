I'm Zahra Abbasi, a Machine Learning Engineer passionate about AI. In September 2023, I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Alzahra University in Tehran, Iran.
Soon after, I started working as a Machine Learning Engineer at <a href='http://en.pfkvision.com'> Pouya Fanavaran Kosar </a>, a company that works on machine vision technology.
In this role, I successfully developed and deployed machine learning models for diverse applications, such as object detection and image classification. I also worked on training and fine-tuning deep learning models to improve their performance and accuracy. Additionally, I was involved in the development of applications that use machine learning models for different tasks. You can find more details about my work experience in <a href='/projects'>Projects</a> section.
