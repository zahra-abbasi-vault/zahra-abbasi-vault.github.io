The Sampi Sorter is a state-of-the-art sorting machine that leverages artificial intelligence to precisely categorize grains and agricultural products according to their visual properties.

I contributed to the development of The Sampi Sorter, an intelligent agricultural grain sorter. 
In this industrial project, I served as an AI developer. 
My responsibilities included training high accuracy models for accurate bean detection and classification.
I successfully fine-tuned the YOLOv8 model with 99% accuracy in bean detection. 
Subsequently, for each product , I implemented a CNN model for high accuracy classification.
Coffee beans are the lastes bean types that were added.
