## Overview
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Sampi Sorter is a state-of-the-art sorting machine that leverages artificial intelligence to precisely categorize grains and agricultural products according to their visual properties. <a href="https://www.sorter.ir/en/" target="_blank">Project Website</a></p>

## My Contributions

<p style="text-align: justify;">In this industrial project, I served as the AI developer. My responsibilities included training high-accuracy models for accurate bean detection and classification.<br/> I successfully fine-tuned the YOLOv8 model with 99% accuracy in bean detection. Subsequently, for each type of bean, I implemented a CNN model for high-accuracy classification. I was part of this project for multiple products such as lentils, Cowpea, and coffee beans.</p>


### Detection Model Output

<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the challenges I faced was detecting coffee beans in the image below. Due to the hardware limitations, the model's input size couldn't be increased much, and for the tracking algorithm, the box loss needed to decrease as much as possible. In the end, the model achieved 99% accuracy in detection.</p>

### Classification Model Output


<p style="text-align: justify;">Here are some outputs from the classification models. The images show the latest product, coffee beans, that were added to the system. I trained different models for each type of defect.</p>

### Detecting Coffee Berry Borer Damaged

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Coffee Berry Borer, or Hypthenemus Hampei, is one of the most significant pest problems for coffee farmers.</p>

### Detecting Shell
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shell is a common defect where coffee beans have a large cavity similar to a shell.</p>
