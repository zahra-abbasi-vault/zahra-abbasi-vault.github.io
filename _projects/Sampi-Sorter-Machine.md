The Sampi Sorter is a state-of-the-art sorting machine that leverages artificial intelligence to precisely categorize grains and agricultural products according to their visual properties.

Contributed to the development of The Sampi Sorter, an intelligent agricultural grain sorter. In this industrial project, I served as an AI developer. My responsibilities included training a YOLO model for accurate bean detection and subsequently training a CNN to classify each detected bean into its respective category. This project presented challenging tasks in both detection and classification, ultimately improving efficiency in the sorting process.
