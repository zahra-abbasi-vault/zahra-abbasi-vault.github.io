The Karabin Embedded LPR Camera is a comprehensive all-in-one system, featuring color and infrared cameras, image processing, control and power electronic units, and a specialized lighting module for ANPR. The process of LPR is done exclusively and independently of any external processing unit, requiring only a power supply. Its output includes license plates and images of passing vehicles.

## My Contributions

### Persian Plate Character Recognition
I developed a CNN model achieving 98% accuracy in recognizing 10 numbers and over 25 Persian letters. Previously, the system relied on pure image processing algorithms. My contribution significantly enhanced plate reading accuracy through deep learning.

### Vehicle Type Classification
I implemented a classification system for vehicles into six categories: sedan, bus, minibus, truck, pickup, and van. This system works for both front and rear views, using a lightweight CNN model deployable on commercial embedded processors at over 20 FPS. The classification accuracy exceeds 98%.

### Vehicle Model Recognition
I spearheaded the development of a model recognition system for vehicles passing the Karabin camera. We collected data from over 95% of vehicle models in the country's market, covering nearly 700 models. I trained two main models for front and rear views, achieving 97% accuracy with a medium-weight CNN model. This project is a significant achievement in our country, with the model being retrained monthly to include new vehicle models.

Working on this project was a great honor for me, as it contributes to making roads safer, preventing car crashes, and preserving lives by controlling vehicle speed.
