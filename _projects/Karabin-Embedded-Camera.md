The Karabin Embedded LPR Camera is a comprehensive all-in-one system, featuring color and infrared cameras, image processing, control and power electronic units, and a specialized lighting module for ANPR. In this project, I played a role in enhancing its capabilities by integrating a vehicle-type classification module. This addition expanded the functionality of the system, providing advanced features for efficient vehicle monitoring and categorization.
