## Overview
<p style="text-align: justify;">Engineered a comprehensive safety system utilizing Deep Stream for precise pedestrian detection on crosswalks and radar technology to identify approaching vehicles. Implemented on Jetson Orin Nano, this system is designed to enhance road safety by issuing timely warnings to both pedestrians and drivers, ensuring a proactive approach to preventing potential accidents at crosswalks.</p>

## My Contributions
<p style="text-align: justify;">From the beginning of the project to the end, I was responsible for the development of the system. I implemented the pedestrian detection model using Deep Stream and integrated a radar in my solution for vehicle detection. Finally, I developed a decision-making algorithm for the system. I also developed a UI for the system using PyQt5.</p>



## Challenges
<ul>
<li><p style="text-align: justify;">The challenges I faced were related to the hardware limitations of the Jetson Orin Nano and the need to optimize the system for real-time performance. However, through careful algorithm optimization and system integration, I successfully met these challenges and delivered a robust solution that met the project requirements.</p></li>

<li><p style="text-align: justify;">For best performance, I decided to use Deep Stream and Gstreamer. Using these technologies and integrating them into my Python solution was my biggest challenge due to the lack of documentation and examples. However, in the end, I managed to do it successfully.</p></li>
</ul>
