## Overview
<p style="text-align: justify;">
I contributed to the development of Level-1 Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS). After more than 6 months of focused research, AI and Computer Vision algorithms were created and optimized, 
meeting the specified performance goals for the Departure Warning (LDW) and High Beam Assist (HBA) systems. </p>

## My Contributions
<p style="text-align: justify;">
I designed and developed the CNN architecture and decision-making algorithms of HBA in this
project. Additionally, I contributed to the development of the detection system with Deep Stream
in FCW algorithm.

## Challenges

<p style="text-align: justify;">Due to the hardware limitations of the Jetson Nano, I had to optimize the model size and the inference time to meet the real-time requirements. Furthermore, situable datasets were not available for training the HBA model , so I had to create my own dataset. For this perpous I used CVAT annotation tool to lable objects (such as street lights , signs , vehicles front and rear lights , etc). Thanks to our annotating team, the dataset was ready in a short time.</p>
