This Level-1 ADAS project utilizes a monocular camera with an NVIDIA Jetson Nano board. After more than 6 months of focused research, we have effectively created and optimized AI and Computer Vision algorithms, meeting the specified performance goals for the Departure Warning (LDW) and High Beam Assist (HBA) systems. I contributed to the design of the CNN architecture and decision-making algorithms of HBA in this projet.
